# Human-machine Collaborative (H-M-C) DL Development Code
Here, we show the code proposed by this study for the comparison studies (classic model training and pure machine annotation)

## CODE overview
+ CODE 1: code for classic model training in the model training comparison test
+ CODE 2: code for pure machine annotation in the annotation comparison test

### Pre-train
+ Python 3.8
+ keras 2.2.4
+ pip install -r requirements.txt

### CODE 1
In the model training comparison test, we utilised the training datasets with ground truth labels to develop classic convolutional neural networks with ResNet-50, Inception-V3, Inception-ResNet-V2, and EfficientNet-B4 network architectures

#### Training and testing
```
cd /CODE1/{each dir}/project

python train.py # for train
or
python predict.py  # for test
```
### CODE 2
For the pure machine method on the classification datasets, a series of unsupervised clustering algorithms were applied to cluster the images based on the representation vectors generated by a ResNet-50 network or a denoising autoencoder
